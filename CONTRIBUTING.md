Hello,
This is my first repository on GitHub and I would like you to help me move forward with this project of creating a portfolio, much like a personal resume for a student, in particular.
Thanks!

So far, the portfolio looks very simple. I'd love to add a parallax design to it. You are welcome to add other cool animations/designs if you'd like to contribute.

The repository has only one branch, the master branch right now. You can make pull requests on this branch. Please follow the directory structureto make it easy for me to review and merge your requests.

The repositories has following directories:

i) css - contains css stylesheets
ii) fonts - contains the roboto font. You may not need this if you decide to change the fonts of the text on the page. Also, chances are that the page right now does not use the roboto font. I mostly use google fonts. You may need net connectivity to see the correct fonts I've used (in case I haven't included the fonts used in the fonts directory).
iii) images- contains backdrop image and icons.
iv) js - contains the javascript files. 
v) Of course, the index.html file is the homepage of my portfolio and contains the code for the same.

# How to contribute to this project?

3. Make changes to the project and commit them.
4. Once you are satisfied with the results you can push the changes you made to the origin remote.

At this point I'll be notified of your contributions. I'll review the contributions you made and merge them to my master branch if I want to include them to my project.

Even if, for some reason I don't merge your pull request, I want you to know that I appreciate your contribution. Thanks!
