# little-red-dress

This is my portfolio - a place where you can find all the projects that I've worked on and my professional achievements. I've made the code for this portfolio available as a public repository on Github. You can check it out and contribute to it, if you'd like. You can find some information on how to do that in the contributing.md file.
